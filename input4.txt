Probably Lentz's most engaging piece: Missa Umbrarum the title piece uses an interesting process: A number of 30-second electronic delays are used to slowly build up to the final "destination" for each phrase of the Mass. The nonvocal music comes entirely from crystal glasses (as per a glass harmonica) played by the vocalists. On the first repetition of a phrase the lowest notes of the section are supplied and then the singers drink from the glasses before adding the next layer. In the end each phrase is built from half-a-dozen or more layers turning the handful of vocalists (and glasses) into a full choir. Despite the technique the final result does not sound dense and muddy; an ethereal nature is retained throughout.
