A waste of money: I had to listen to this by myself. I wouldn't want to subject this "music" to others. It's not that I'm new to "noise/fuzz" pop. I own and enjoy many CDs by Sonic Youth My Bloody Valentine Dinosaur Jr. but this band just lacks the ability to put together listenable tunes. I had to sell this sorry collection of "tunes" after 3 or 4 listens. I gave it a chance but each time I listened to it I lost even more interest.
