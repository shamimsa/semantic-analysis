Easy on your skin and removes make up easily.: I first found these at Trader Joe's and picked them up on a whim. I was pleasantly surprised at how well they removed my makeup and left my skin feeling clean and cared for and have often followed with moisturizer after a long day at work so I could at least get my makeup off before I went to bed. Of course for days that I have more time and energy I can follow with my normal cleansing routine.I've tried a few other brands but have always returned to Comodyne's as the other brands would start to irritate my skin even in a weeks time and I've never experienced any irritation with Comodyne's.I ordered the 3-pack this time but will order the 6-pack next time for the value and would definitely buy it through the Subscribe & Save program if it were offered.
